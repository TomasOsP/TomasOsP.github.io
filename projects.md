## Pedal Guitar Design

## Capacitive Sensor for Bacteriophage Detection
We designed a capacitive IoT sensor that recognizes bacteriophages within the subtamces. This attempt to reduce the time of analysis it  takes to recognize bacteriophage in traditional methods (which usually takes more than a day) by only takig about 15 minutes to show data results and sharing it through WiFi to connected devices.

## Surface PCB welding furnace
During one of the final year courses of my bachelor's degree. I worked in the coding and design of a DIY furnace. We were one of the most outstanding teams within the class by designing a low-cost, small and effective furnace able to control the heat of the chamber and reaching a high controlled temperature of 300 Â°C.
